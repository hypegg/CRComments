# Privacy Policy for CRComments Extension

## Introduction

CRComments ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension handles user data and ensures compliance with Google Chrome's Web Store policies.

## Data Collection and Use

### Site Content
The CRComments extension captures the site content of Crunchyroll pages to integrate Disqus comments directly below the video player. This involves modifying the DOM and embedding the Disqus commenting system within the page. The captured content is used solely for the purpose of enhancing user interaction on Crunchyroll and is not collected, transmitted, or stored by the extension.

### User Preferences
The extension stores user preferences locally using Chrome's storage API. This includes data such as whether you have seen the welcome overlay. This data is stored on your device and is not transmitted to us or any third party.

## Permissions

The CRComments extension requests the following permissions:
- **activeTab**: This permission is required to detect when the user is on a Crunchyroll page and to inject the necessary scripts for displaying Disqus comments.
- **storage**: This permission is used to store user preferences locally on your device.

## Use of Remote Code

The CRComments extension does not use any remote code. All JavaScript and other resources used by the extension are included within the extension package itself. There are no references to external files in `<script>` tags, modules that point to external files, or strings evaluated by `eval()`.

## Data Security

We take data security seriously and implement measures to protect your data. The extension adheres to Chrome's content security policy to ensure that all scripts are securely loaded.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.
